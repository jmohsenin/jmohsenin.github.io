title:  "Reduce batch size"
---

One of the most effective yet under-utilized methods of speeding up product development is to reduce batch size. A batch is a completed unit of work, and batch size is the total amount of work in the batch. 

### Why reduce batch size?
- **Smaller batches means end users get some benefit sooner**: shipping some UI polish in one week means your users will enjoy a more polished product sooner than if you had shipped that polish as part of a redesign that took one month. A change to landing page copy that improves conversions by 1% will increase revenue now versus waiting.
- **Smaller batches means you get feedback sooner**: faster feedback leads to better products. Smaller batches leads you to be informed sooner which helps your future batches.
- **Smaller batches makes reprioritization easier**: it is easier to re-prioritize work in-between batches than in the middle of a batch (sunk cost fallacy, switching costs). Smaller batches means more instances between batches. Your prioritization decisions also get better because you get feedback sooner.
- **Smaller batches reduce variations in flow**: all processes have limits on the amount of flow they can support, and large batches frequently blow past that limit, causing slowdown. A restaurant might be able to handle a dozen customers throughout the day, but a 100-person group will overwhelm the kitchen.
- **Smaller batches reduce overhead**: less management is needed of smaller batches. If a new feature has 10 open bugs, a new bug reports needs to be checked for duplication 10 times. If a new feature has 100 open bugs, it needs to be checked 100 times.
- **Smaller batches are easier to cancel**: priorities change, conflict, or turn out to be incorrect. Smaller batches are easier to cancel because there is less a sunk cost, and a lower chance that priorities have changed since the batch started.
  
There are second-order benefits to reducing batch size:
- **Smaller batches reduces process friction**: smaller batches will hit friction in shipping processes (e.g. â€œhow many people need to get sign off on a copy change?") much more frequently than larger batches, so fixing that friction will become higher priority. 
- **Smaller batches encourage more urgency**: a designer soley responsible for a tweak to the site header due three days from now is going to feel a lot more urgency than if they were part of a team of five responsible for a site navigation refresh due in three months.
- **Smaller batches encourage more experimentation**: because the risks of small batches are lower, experimenting with potentially risky changes becomes easier.
- **Smaller batches are more fun**: a lot of people derive joy out of shipping work, and smaller batches means more of those moments.
