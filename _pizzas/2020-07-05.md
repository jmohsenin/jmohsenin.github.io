- 1x Apollonia (Una Pizza Napoletana): egg, pancetta, black pepper, garlic, basil
- 2x Marghertia

Notes
- Buffalo mozzarella was a huge upgrade; wet enough that it won't dry out if it cooks on the pizza the entire time
- Tomato sauce made from Italbrand tomatoes also great; just pureed with a little salt
- 280g dough balls too big for Koda 13, need to target 225-250g
- Dough stretching technique needs work
    - I think it's getting too thin in the center and needs to be more even
    - Don't push down with finger tips so hard, pat it down with pads of fingers
    - Try out [this method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR2Teqs4qc4) of stretching dough
    - Anthony method of flipping it over a few times but to not try and take the air out of it
- Appollonia didn't come out right; was basically scrambled eggs on pizza
    - Need to add it very late and use spoon to drizzle it on the pizza
    - Do less than a whole egg
    - Add black pepper and fresh garlic
