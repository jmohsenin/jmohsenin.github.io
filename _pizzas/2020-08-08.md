- 1x Marghertia
- 1x Pepper Medley: jalepe√±os, shall
- 1x Proscuitto + goat cheese + fig jam
- 1x Spicy salami + honey

Notes
- Used dry-farm early girl tomatoes for sauce; was too sweet and overpowered the rest of the flavories
- Dough sat for too long (3h), absored a lot of flour, and bottom got too burnt as a result.
