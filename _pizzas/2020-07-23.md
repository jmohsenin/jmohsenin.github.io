- Bottom comes out much crispier when stone is 800+ F
- 225g is really perfect dough size for Koda 13, small enough that the pie can get decent distance from the flame and thus crust doesn't burnt
- Putting tomato sauce, cheese, olive oil all on beforehand gets everything nice and creamy
- Salami and basil only need 30s in the oven
