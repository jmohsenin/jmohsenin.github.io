- 2x Margherita

- What went well
    - Dough was a perfect consistency when I started at 10:45a and cooked at 6:30a
    - Turning the heat up between pizzas to get it back to 800 is a good move to get the bottom sufficiently crispy
    - Prosciutto arugula was pretty good
    - Flaky salt on all pretty good
- What didn't go well
    - Rolling pin doesn't really help - makes it all too flat/uniform and doesn't give it a good crust
    - Taste is still not there
        - Sort of feels like all the ingredients aren't meshing
        - Doesn't feel like a full mouth feel, too bready or boring
        - Tomato sauce is too chunky/watery?
- What to try next time
    - Sample some pizzas from Pizzahacker, Delfina and study then (maybe go to the restaurant?)
    - Look for a pizza making class
    - Consult with Kamran
    - Try store bought tomato sauce again
