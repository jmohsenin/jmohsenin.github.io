pies: 5
---
- 1x Margherita
- 2x Arriabiata (+Bacon)
- 2x Starbelly Green Goddess (+Bacon)

Notes
- My technique still isn’t there yet the pizzas were too thin and had too much crust on them
- Dough was really hard to work with, wasn’t stretchy and elastic
- Next time, try dough from Pizza Shop, Delfina, Pizzhacker
