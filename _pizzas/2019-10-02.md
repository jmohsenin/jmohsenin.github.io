pies: 5
---
- 1x Margherita
- 2x Arriabiata: tomato sauce mixed with Calabrian Chili
- 2x Green Goddess (Starbelly): arugula, bacon, green goddess dressing

Notes
- My technique still isn’t there yet the pizzas were too thin and had too much crust on them
- Dough was really hard to work with, wasn’t stretchy and elastic
- Next time, try dough from Pizza Shop, Delfina, Pizzhacker
