- 1x Margherita
- 1x Panna (Delfina): margherita + cream + sliced parmesan
- 3x Nduja + pepperoncini
- 3x Potato, pancetta, rosemary

Notes
- What went well:
    - Pizzas came out really nice, best set I've ever done in general
    - Both potato and nduja were delicious, fully flavored
    - Smoked salt on the crown was nice
    - Potato really benefitted from:
        - Nice olive oil pre-cooking
        - Lots of chives and rosemary
    - Bianco sauce was a huge upgrade over my own tomato sauce
        - Mixed with chilbrean was nice
    - Olive oil drizzled on the margarita was really nice
    - My dough stretching technique getting better, dough still feels pretty chewy and not as airy as Pizzahacker's, but better than before
- What didn't go well:
    - Don't feel like my cream situation is ideal
    - Panna still not working, need to study Delfina's
