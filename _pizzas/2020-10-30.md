- 2x Bianca (Piccino): parmesan, pecorino, mozzarella, red pepper flakes, sliced garlic
- 2x Prosciutto + arugula
- Pepperoni + pepperoncini

- Dough didn't rise much, I think the starter is a little weak and needs to be re-strenghtened
- Tossing arugula with olive oil + lemon made a big difference, add some balsamic next time
