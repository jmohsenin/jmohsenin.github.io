- 1x Garlic cream and chard
- 2x Calabrian chili, roasted red peppers, dandelion greens
- 1x Ricotta cream, spinach, garlic

- Garlic cream and chard was really tasty and beautiful, basically a cheesy garlic bread with chard
- Red peppers are too watery to use, could try again and roast them for much longer, they just tasted soggy
- Used too much Ricotta, pie became floppy
- Split Lamonica dough into 220g balls, came out OK but very thin, would like to try a 300-350g ball for a thicker crust/longer cook time
- Really overdid it on quantity, had 3 cups and barely used 1 cup
