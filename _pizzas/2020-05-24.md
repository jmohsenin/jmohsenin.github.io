- Swiss chard and garlic cream
- 2x Bianca: pecorino, mozzerella, paremesean, sliced garlic, red pepper flakes

Notes
- Did 3 x 280g balls slightly too big — 250g definitely the ticket
- The dough balls being too big causes the crust to be too chewy
- Got pretty close on the Piccino Bianca — need to go light on the mozz (has so much moisture, add pecorino, and do 1:1:1 ratio. Make chili oil spicier, needed to kick it up with flakes
- Don't scrimp on the garlic slices, they aren't too flavorful
- Put garlic in close to the end so that they don’t burn
- Try cooking at a lower temp generally – when I did Delfina's pizzas at 600 way back when they came out really nice
- Consistently undercooking the pizzas — cook em longer
- Kale pesto and garlic cream was delish do that more
- Chard needs to be very moist and out in late as to not burn
- The soft dough is really difficult to get out of the box — think of different solutions. More flour helped a lot though
- Watch some more videos on how to shape dough,
