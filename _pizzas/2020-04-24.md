- Put toppings on pizza after putting it in better, less burnt
- Pizza shop dough just too wet for neopolitan style pizza
- Pizza needs hours to settle putting into a ball – prepared at 4:30, was unworkable at 5:30, was barely OK at 6:30, much better by 7:30
- Basil creme was a hit – much better than regular basil 
- Cherry tomatoes oven roasted for a bit with pepper flakes and olive oil ++
- Use real anchovies not the paste
