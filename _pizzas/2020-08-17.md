Debugging naturally-leavened dough
- Is my starter in good shape?
    - Should double in size after today's feeding
    - Conducted float test (dollop of starter should float in glass of water) but my starter failed
- Levain 
    - Use correct water temp + wait for room temp to be regular levels (60ish)
    - Check that levain doubled in size
    - Switch to high-protein bread flour instead of 00
- After feeding, starter didn't rise on kitchen counter overnight but rose a ton in the oven (no heat just oven light). Must be too cold on the counter.
