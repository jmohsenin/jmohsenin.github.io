Debugging naturally-leavened dough pt. 2
- Starter didn't rise at all after yesterday's feeding. I think it didn't get strong enough before I started refrigerating it. Going to leave it out and feed it 2x a day at a 1:2 ratio (25g starter, 50g water, 50g flour) for a week or so and see what happens.
