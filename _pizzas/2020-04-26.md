- Prepped Beddia dough out at 8:45, pull Ken dough at 10:30
- Ken dough seems like it hasn't risen at all. Maybe there isn't enough yeast, or I didn't properly activate the yeast. Hard to cut that recipe in half given how little yeast content there is. 
- Alex said she did half of Ken's dough after 24hrs and second half after 36hrs and the second batch came out much lighter/less dense. Good idea for next time, esp since I've got the fridge space. 
- Beddia dough was very flat and stretchy, barely held together. Ended up splitting it into 4 dough balls that were 215g each. Had I left it to sit for longer after rerolling I think it could have been nice.
- Yeast is not dead tested it
