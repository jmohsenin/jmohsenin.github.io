Notes
- 200g per pizza too little, need to use 250g+
- 36hr total ferment, think it was too long, stick to 24hr or try Saturday pizza dough
- Use much more flour on the bottom so it doesn't stick so much
- Dough
  - Making 24-48hr dough, 1.5x quantity
  - Scale not accurate enough for salt/yeast, did 3 tsp of salt, 1/2 tsp on yeast
  - Timeline
      - Started at 8:20
      - Mixed at 8:40
      - Kneaded at 9:00
      - Turned into dough balls at 11:30
  - Became 6x 200g dough balls, want to aim for 250g in the future
