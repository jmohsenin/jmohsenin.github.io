Menu
- 1x Pepperoni with pesto 
- 1x Pepperoni with ricotta
- 1x Marghertia with cherry tomatoes

Notes
- Finally cracked naturally-leavened dough!! It was puffy, spunky, and delicious – a way bigger improvement than I was expecting. Turns out it was my starter - when I mixed the starter for this dough it rose like crazy. 10 days of 2x daily feeding and then 8 days of daily feeding got to be consistently active, doubling in size overnight.
- Ricotta wasn't very tasty, just tasted bland. Think I'll try burrata next time.
