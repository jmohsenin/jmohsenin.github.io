- 2x Bianca (Piccino): parmesan, pecorino, mozzarella, chili oil, garlic
- 2x Potato, pancetta, rosemary

Notes
- Single Ken dough recipe, split into 3 250g dough balls
- Make dough right before people come over on Saturday, in time for Sunday lunch (do regular 24-48hr dough, most compatible with the schedule)
- Want to get dough to rise more
    - Maybe it's OK that the dough doesn't rise: Ken says says the dough will expand rather than rise after a cold ferment
    - "To prevent salt from foiling your bread bakes, measure carefully and never pour yeast and salt on top of one another in your mixing bowl." ([source](https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/9-reasons-your-bread-isnt-rising-and-what-to-do-about-it/))
    - Room could be too cold, try letting it rise in a warm place ([source](https://www.motherearthnews.com/real-food/why-your-bread-dough-doesnt-rise-zbcz1503))

    - Longer fermentation affects leoparding: slower fermentation causes stronger gluten structures, allowing the gluten to expand more and create airer dough
- Caputo 00 Pizzeria flour ([source](https://brickovenbaker.com/pages/information-about-caputo-flours))
    - Pizzeria is 12.5% protein, whereas retail Americana style is 13.5%. 
    - Apparently Pizzeria style is better suited for ovens that are 500+ degrees 
    - brickovenbaker.com has Caputo 00 Pizzeria flour repacked into smaller units, bought 9lbs for $22 (equivalent to 4 regular bags)
- Get some different yeast, I have a sense the corner store yeast isn't good ([source](https://www.boschmixers.com/blog/why-your-bread-dough-isnt-rising/))
    - Ken recommends SAF Red Instant yeast, stored airtight in the fridge for up to 6mo
