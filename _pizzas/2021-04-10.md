- 1st time since mid-Feb, definitely a little rusty
- Didn't pull dough correctly, crust was too thick + too thin in middle
- Ricotta + sopressata + hot honey + garlic was amazing though, definitely a new favorite
- Didn't realize my paddle was only 11.6" wide, have effectively been doing 10" pies with a huge dough ball (280g)
- Bought a 16" peel to try some bigger pies
