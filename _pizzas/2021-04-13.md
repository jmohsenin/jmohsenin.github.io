pies: 3
---
- 2x Margherita
- Sopressata, ricotta, hot honey

---

- Bigger dough ball test: 280g, 300g, 320g
- Big pies are great – 300g is a great size on the big paddle
- Dough can stretch much more than I expect; gets nice and cracker-y if so
- Go lighter on the sauce – don't want any pooling 
- Go light on the oil and cheese too, it should look a little sparse; only the Bianca should be sort of thick and layered
- Pepperoni, pancetta, potatoes – can go on in the beginning on the big Ooni
