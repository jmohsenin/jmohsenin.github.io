- What worked
    - Pizza station was perfect
    - Potato pizza had promise
    - Lots of bottom heat at first and then lower heat throughout seems like a good approach
    - 4 dough balls for 6 people was right (with a 2 calzone mix ups)
    - Semolina was much better than flour
- What didn't
    - Dough got too crusty to work with — by 7:30 was really tough to handle
    - 7:30 was 9.5 hr of room temp, targeting a solid 8 would have been perf or maybe even less
    - Doing pizzas after episode was very stressful, everyone was just waiting on me
    - Dough kept getting too thin in the middle, too thick on sides — maybe try a rolling pin?
    - Few of those pizzas were too bready, needed more toppings to stay interesting
    - Many of them still not round, round really key to getting it right
    - Flame too tall, pizzas kept catching on fire
    - Bottom got too thin on multiple
    - Was doing too much work on the paddles
    - Stop doing garlic bread until I can figure out how to make it more interesting
- Next time
    - Max 8 hours (maybe even less)
    - Try rolling pin
    - Turn the heat even lower when pizza is in there (to avoid catching on fire)
    - Flaky Salt all the pizzas after they come out
    - Sharp cheese on the potato pizza?
